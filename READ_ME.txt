The purpose of this study is to analyze and observe the motion of the Hyundai YL012 type robot arm in a simulation environment using Matlab App Designer GUI. Initially, the focus is on providing input based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) table without activating the robot's simulation, followed by displaying the output on the plot screen. This allows for visualizing the results before activating the simulation.

Once the simulation is activated, the physical movement of the robot can be examined. The alignment between the physical positioning of the robot arm and its representation on the plot screen can be observed. The goal is to ensure that the robot's physical movements match its plotted positions. Additionally, the use of sliders enables real-time control over the robot's movement capabilities, facilitating simultaneous observation of its performance. This approach allows for comprehensive analysis and visualization of the Hyundai YL012 robot arm's behavior and kinematics within the Matlab simulation environment using a user-friendly GUI developed in App Designer.
